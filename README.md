 For taking inventory of your loot

 This is a simple scrapper that recursively scans a folder/drive of your choice, and outputs that data to an excel file also of your choice.
 It doesn't actually organize anything like the name implies--just couldn't resist a pun.

 The 'prefix' column in your excel output captures leading 'A', 'An', 'The', and trailing ', A' ', An' and ', The' off of filenames.

  The dump format is specific for personal use, so usage for anyone besides myself will be limited. It gets the job done for my needs.
  But feel free to scan to your hearts content, if you need an inventory tool!
